This project will guide you through identifying, regularizing, and beautifying various types of curves.

The principal challenge is divided in the following sections.

Regularize Curves: Identify regular shapes on a given set of curves. Task can be broken down into the following primitives: straight line, Circles and Ellipses, Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles, Regular Polygons, Star Shapes

Exploring Symmetry in Curves:check for lines of symmetry where the shape can be divided into mirrored halves for reflection symmetry.

Completing Incomplete Curves: Imagine a set of 2D curves that have been ”planarized,” meaning any overlapping portions have been removed, leaving gaps or partial holes in the curves. The task is to complete these curves in a natural way.
